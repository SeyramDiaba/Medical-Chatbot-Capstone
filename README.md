# Medical-Chatbot-Capstone
This goal of this project is to design a conversational chatbot (using rasa) for a local community. Chatbots are increasingly being used in a variety of
healthcare services to stimulate and engage in a conversation with a user to provide real-
time assistance to patients.
Installation:
To begin, a virtual environment was created where rasa and its dependencies were installed successfully.
